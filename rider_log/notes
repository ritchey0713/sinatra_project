I am creatng a web app for logging motorcyle rides per user.

it will have a signup/login 

a user will be able to create a new log, and store info such as destination, mileage, possibly in the future add in a google maps box? 

add a motorcycle model to store what bike they rode

after logging in be able to see a list of all the users destinations, link them to individual views of each destination 

able to edit info in destinations 

also be able to delete a destination if needed

lock down info so only the user can edit/delete their own posts 

messaging for bad passwords? look this up
