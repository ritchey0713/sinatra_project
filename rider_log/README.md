with this web app you will be able to signup/login and create/view your posts on rides, as well as edit or delete them as you see fit. 

you can clone this from https://github.com/ritchey0713/sinatra_project/tree/master/rider_log

after cloning and opening install gem shotgun and run shotgun in terminal and go to your local host to use it! 

Happy riding!
